# Crier-Unity
Crier is a peer-to-peer service which allows you to see what's going on in the establishments around your vicinity in real-time. When you use Crier, you will see what the environment is like in various establishments without having to call or be there! Notifications such as "Happy Hour at T's from 9pm-12am tonight!" or "Start off Restaurant Week at Louie's with a $19.99 Prix Fixe!" will show up on your phone to alert you of deals and events.
